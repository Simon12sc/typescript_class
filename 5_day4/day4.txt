pnpm add ts-node-dev -D
npm i ts-node-dev -D

we install types of library by 
npm i @types/express so that we won't get error

@types which is already created on github
https://github.com/types

we use this command
 ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only ./src/server.ts
it will gonna run our typescript in watch our ts file

library--> plugin / Dependencies / package 

frame work provides entire environment like express ( for node js) , django (for python),

runtime --> node is runtime because it provide environment only to js. Javascript needs an environment to run which is provided by node js.

10 things regret about nodejs

--> why we still in node js 

Bun is a fast JavaScript
package manager, test runner, runtime, all in one toolkit
still not stable... fastest runtime
https://bun.sh

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. Deno was co-created by Ryan Dahl, who also created Node.js. slower than bun but faster than node js
https://deno.com/


we are still in node js because it is stable. a lots of project on node js in production level.
